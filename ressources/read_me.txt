Welcome to my first video game "SPACE RUSH", it's not perfect but i enjoyed doing it a lot.
Feel free to use my code and create community content.
The controls are simple :
- Press left click to shoot or select.
- Press R to reload.
- Ships have different amounts of HP, 1, 2, 3 according to their size.
- Aim at the ships flying and don't let them pass, otherwise you will lose a heart.
- Once you let 4 ships through you lose.
